  shortBio: `Board-certified ophthalmologist, internationally recognized eye surgeon, surgical innovator and coach -- now serving patients in Connecticut. After training at some of the country's most respected eye programs, Dr. Christopher Sales chose to bring his expertise home to Connecticut, specializing in advanced cataract surgery, DMEK corneal transplants, and EVO ICL vision correction.`,

  fullBio: `Dr. Christopher S. Sales is a board-certified ophthalmologist and fellowship-trained cornea and refractive surgeon practicing with Starling Physicians in Wethersfield, Connecticut. He brings an extraordinary career spanning the nation's premier medical institutions to serve patients in the greater Hartford area.

Dr. Sales earned his B.A. in International Relations from Brown University before pursuing medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, where he received both his MD and MPH degrees with Research Honors. He completed his internship at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, his ophthalmology residency at Stanford University's Byers Eye Institute under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Blumenkranz, and a clinical fellowship in Cornea, External Diseases, and Refractive Surgery at the Devers Eye Institute under Dr. Mark Terry and at the Joint Warfighter Refractive Surgery Center under Dr. Charles Reilly.

After fellowship, Dr. Sales served as an attending surgeon at the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston before joining Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where he spent four years as an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology and became the first surgeon in New York City to perform DMEK corneal transplant surgery. He launched the EVO ICL program at Weill Cornell and established himself as a leader in advanced corneal and refractive surgery.

In 2020, he joined the University of Iowa as a tenure-track faculty member, rising to tenured Associate Professor and serving as Vice Chair for Health Equity and a CIRCA Fellow. At Iowa, he founded the Iowa Eye Device Lab, a multidisciplinary innovation hub that brought together ophthalmologists, biomedical engineers, and industry partners to develop patented surgical devices. He also served as Associate Medical Director of the Iowa Lions Eye Bank and launched the university's EVO ICL program.

In 2024, Dr. Sales founded Oko-Tek Inc., a medical device company dedicated to commercializing innovations from his research. He was selected as an inaugural member of the Stanford BioDesign Global Faculty Training Program in MedTech Entrepreneurship that same year.

Dr. Sales has authored 50+ peer-reviewed publications, holds multiple patents for surgical devices, and was inducted into the National Academy of Inventors in 2023. His expertise in DMEK surgery has made him a sought-after educator worldwide, having trained 15+ cornea fellows and 40+ ophthalmology residents, and leading skills transfer courses at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, ASCRS, and the Cornea Society. He received the Gold Medal for Notable Contributions to Endothelial Keratoplasty from the Indian Intraocular Implant & Refractive Surgery Convention in 2024.

Beyond his clinical and academic work, Dr. Sales has dedicated time to volunteer surgical missions in Tanzania, Guatemala, and Mauritius, and served in relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina. His commitment to global eye health and health equity runs throughout his career.`,

  philosophy: `My approach to patient care is rooted in the belief that every individual deserves access to the most advanced, evidence-based treatments available. I combine cutting-edge surgical techniques with compassionate, personalized care to help each patient achieve their best possible vision. Innovation in surgery should ultimately serve one purpose: improving outcomes for patients.`,
