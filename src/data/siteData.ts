  shortBio: `Dr. Christopher S. Sales is a board-certified, fellowship-trained cornea and refractive surgeon now practicing with Starling Physicians in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Formerly a tenured Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and founding director of the Iowa Eye Device Lab at the University of Iowa, Dr. Sales brings over two decades of experience in DMEK corneal transplantation, LASIK, and advanced surgical innovation. He has trained more than 13 cornea fellows and 39 ophthalmology residents and is recognized internationally as a leader in surgical education and ophthalmic device development.`,

  fullBio: `Dr. Christopher S. Sales is a board-certified, fellowship-trained cornea and refractive surgeon practicing with Starling Physicians in Wethersfield, Connecticut. He brings an extraordinary career spanning the nation's premier medical institutions to serve patients in the greater Hartford area.

Dr. Sales earned his B.A. in International Relations from Brown University before pursuing medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, where he received both his MD and MPH degrees with Research Honors. He completed his internship at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, his ophthalmology residency at Stanford University's Byers Eye Institute, and a clinical fellowship in Cornea, External Diseases, and Refractive Surgery at the Devers Eye Institute and Joint Warfighter Refractive Surgery Center.

After fellowship, Dr. Sales served as an attending surgeon at the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston before joining Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where he spent four years as an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology. In 2020, he joined the University of Iowa as a tenure-track faculty member, rising to tenured Associate Professor and serving as Vice Chair for Health Equity and a CIRCA (Center for Inclusive Research, Community, and Access) Fellow. At Iowa, he founded the Iowa Eye Device Lab, a multidisciplinary innovation hub that brought together ophthalmologists, biomedical engineers, and industry partners to develop patented surgical devices. He also served as Associate Medical Director of the Iowa Lions Eye Bank.

In 2024, Dr. Sales founded Oko-Tek Inc., a medical device company dedicated to commercializing innovations from his research. He was selected as an inaugural member of the Stanford BioDesign Global Faculty Training Program in MedTech Entrepreneurship that same year.

Dr. Sales has authored 49+ peer-reviewed publications, holds multiple patents for surgical devices, and was inducted into the National Academy of Inventors in 2023. His expertise in DMEK surgery has made him a sought-after educator worldwide, leading skills transfer courses at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, ASCRS, and the Cornea Society. He received the Gold Medal for Notable Contributions to Endothelial Keratoplasty from the Indian Intraocular Implant & Refractive Surgery Convention in 2024.

Beyond his clinical and academic work, Dr. Sales has dedicated time to volunteer surgical missions in Tanzania, Guatemala, and Mauritius, and served in relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina. His commitment to global eye health and health equity runs throughout his career.`,

  philosophy: `My approach to patient care is rooted in the belief that every individual deserves access to the most advanced, evidence-based treatments available. I combine cutting-edge surgical techniques with compassionate, personalized care to help each patient achieve their best possible vision. Innovation in surgery should ultimately serve one purpose: improving outcomes for patients.`,
