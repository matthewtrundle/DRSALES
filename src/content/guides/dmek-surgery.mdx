## What is DMEK Surgery?

**Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK)** is the most advanced form of corneal transplant surgery available today. Unlike traditional full-thickness corneal transplants, DMEK selectively replaces only the thin innermost layer of the cornea—the endothelium and Descemet membrane—which is responsible for keeping the cornea clear.

This targeted approach offers significant advantages over older transplant techniques, including:

- **Faster visual recovery** (weeks rather than months)
- **Better final vision** (most patients achieve 20/25 or better)
- **Lower rejection rates** (less than 1% per year)
- **Minimal change to eye structure**
- **Quicker return to normal activities**

Dr. Sales is internationally recognized as a leader in DMEK surgery, having performed thousands of these procedures and trained surgeons worldwide in his techniques.

## Who is a Candidate for DMEK?

DMEK surgery is primarily indicated for conditions that affect the corneal endothelium:

### Fuchs' Dystrophy
The most common reason for DMEK surgery. Fuchs' dystrophy causes the endothelial cells to gradually die off, leading to corneal swelling and cloudy vision.

### Bullous Keratopathy
Corneal swelling that can occur after cataract surgery or other eye procedures when the endothelium is damaged.

### Failed Previous Transplants
DMEK can be used to replace a previous corneal transplant that has failed.

### Other Endothelial Diseases
Various inherited or acquired conditions affecting the endothelial layer.

**You may NOT be a good candidate if you have:**
- Significant corneal scarring (may need full-thickness transplant)
- Severe glaucoma with multiple previous surgeries
- Certain anatomical variations
- Unrealistic expectations about recovery

## DMEK vs. Other Corneal Transplant Types

| Feature | DMEK | DSAEK | Traditional (PK) |
|---------|------|-------|------------------|
| Tissue Replaced | Endothelium only (10-15 microns) | Endothelium + some stroma | Full cornea |
| Visual Recovery | 1-3 months | 3-6 months | 12-18 months |
| Final Vision | Excellent (20/25+) | Good (20/30+) | Variable |
| Rejection Risk | ~1%/year | ~1-2%/year | ~5-10%/year |
| Sutures | None | Usually none | Many (removed over years) |
| Astigmatism Risk | Very low | Low | High |

### Why Choose DMEK Over DSAEK?

While DSAEK (Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty) is also an effective procedure, DMEK offers several advantages:

1. **Thinner graft**: The DMEK graft is only 10-15 microns thick, compared to 100-200 microns for DSAEK
2. **Better optics**: The thinner graft causes less optical aberration
3. **Faster recovery**: Patients typically see well within weeks
4. **Natural anatomy**: More closely restores the eye's natural structure

## The DMEK Procedure

### Before Surgery

**Preparation includes:**
- Comprehensive eye examination
- Corneal mapping and thickness measurements
- Coordination with the eye bank for donor tissue
- Discussion of risks, benefits, and expectations
- Pre-operative eye drops (usually starting 1-3 days before)

### During Surgery

DMEK is typically performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia:

1. **Donor tissue preparation**: The thin endothelial layer is carefully separated from donor cornea
2. **Patient preparation**: The eye is numbed and prepared
3. **Diseased tissue removal**: The patient's damaged endothelium is gently stripped away
4. **Graft insertion**: The donor tissue is inserted through a small incision (2-3mm)
5. **Positioning**: An air bubble is injected to press the graft against the patient's cornea
6. **Securing**: The graft adheres naturally without sutures

The procedure typically takes 45-60 minutes.

### After Surgery

**Immediate post-operative period:**
- You will lie face-up for several hours to help the graft attach
- The air bubble will gradually absorb over 24-48 hours
- Vision will be blurry initially (this is normal)

**First few days:**
- Multiple eye drop medications
- Face-up positioning recommended for sleeping
- Avoid rubbing or pressing on the eye
- Follow-up appointment within 24-48 hours

## Recovery Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Vision improving but still blurry
- Air bubble gradually absorbing
- Daily or every-other-day check-ups may be needed

**Weeks 2-4:**
- Significant vision improvement for most patients
- Return to most daily activities
- Continue eye drop regimen

**Months 1-3:**
- Vision typically stabilizes
- Eye drop frequency decreases
- Most patients achieve their best vision

**Long-term:**
- Annual check-ups to monitor graft health
- Continue low-dose steroid drops indefinitely (typically once daily)

## Success Rates and Outcomes

DMEK has excellent outcomes when performed by an experienced surgeon:

- **Graft survival**: Over 95% at 5 years
- **Visual acuity**: 80-90% achieve 20/25 or better
- **Rejection episodes**: Less than 1% per year (most are reversible if caught early)
- **Patient satisfaction**: Very high

### Factors Affecting Success

**Positive factors:**
- Early-stage disease
- Healthy eye otherwise
- Compliant with medications and follow-up
- Experienced surgeon

**Challenging factors:**
- Previous eye surgeries
- Glaucoma
- Shallow anterior chamber
- Iris abnormalities

## Potential Risks and Complications

While DMEK is very safe, potential complications include:

### Early Complications (First Few Days)
- **Graft detachment** (5-15% may need re-bubbling procedure)
- Air bubble touching the pupil (can cause pressure increase)
- Bleeding

### Late Complications
- **Rejection** (rare, usually treatable)
- Graft failure
- Glaucoma
- Cataract progression

Most complications are manageable when detected early, which is why follow-up appointments are crucial.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does DMEK surgery take?
The procedure typically takes 45-60 minutes. Plan to be at the surgery center for 2-3 hours total.

### Is DMEK surgery painful?
No. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. You may feel some pressure but not pain. After surgery, mild discomfort is common but manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers.

### How soon can I drive after DMEK?
This varies by patient. Some can drive within 1-2 weeks, while others may take longer. You must have adequate vision in at least one eye and be off sedating medications.

### Will I need glasses after DMEK?
DMEK primarily corrects corneal clarity, not focusing power. Most patients still need glasses for reading and may need them for distance if they did before surgery. DMEK can often be combined with cataract surgery to address both issues.

### How long do I need to use eye drops?
You'll use multiple drops frequently in the first weeks, gradually tapering over months. Most patients use a low-dose steroid drop once daily long-term to prevent rejection.

### Can DMEK be repeated if it fails?
Yes. If a DMEK graft fails, it can usually be replaced with another DMEK procedure.

### What is "re-bubbling"?
If the graft partially detaches (happens in 5-15% of cases), a simple in-office procedure can re-attach it by injecting another air bubble. This is usually very successful.
