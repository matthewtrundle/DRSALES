## What is LASIK?

**LASIK** (Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis) is the world's most popular vision correction procedure. It uses a precise laser to reshape the cornea, correcting how light focuses on the retina and reducing or eliminating dependence on glasses and contact lenses.

LASIK can correct:
- **Myopia (nearsightedness)**: Difficulty seeing distant objects
- **Hyperopia (farsightedness)**: Difficulty seeing close objects
- **Astigmatism**: Blurred vision at all distances due to irregular corneal shape

Since its FDA approval in 1999, LASIK has helped millions of people achieve visual freedom. Modern LASIK uses advanced wavefront-guided and topography-guided technology for personalized treatment and exceptional outcomes.

## Are You a Candidate for LASIK?

### Basic Requirements

**Age**: 18+ (ideally 21+ when vision has stabilized)

**Stable prescription**: No significant change in glasses prescription for at least 1 year

**Healthy eyes**: No active eye diseases, infections, or conditions affecting healing

**Adequate corneal thickness**: Enough tissue to safely reshape

**Realistic expectations**: Understanding what LASIK can and cannot achieve

### Ideal Candidates

You're likely a good candidate if you:
- Are between 21-40 years old
- Have moderate myopia (-1.00 to -8.00 diopters)
- Have mild to moderate astigmatism (up to 3.00 diopters)
- Have stable vision for at least 12 months
- Have healthy corneas with adequate thickness
- Don't have severe dry eye
- Are not pregnant or nursing

### Who May NOT Be a Candidate

LASIK may not be appropriate if you have:

**Eye Conditions:**
- Keratoconus or other corneal diseases
- Severe dry eye syndrome
- Advanced glaucoma
- Cataracts
- Uncontrolled eye disease

**Health Conditions:**
- Autoimmune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Immunodeficiency conditions
- Pregnancy or nursing

**Other Factors:**
- Very thin corneas
- Extremely high prescriptions
- Large pupils in dim light (relative)
- History of poor wound healing

If you're not a candidate for LASIK, alternatives like PRK or ICL may be options. Dr. Sales will evaluate all possibilities during your consultation.

## LASIK vs. Other Vision Correction Options

### LASIK vs. PRK

| Feature | LASIK | PRK |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Creates corneal flap | Yes | No |
| Recovery speed | Fast (1-2 days) | Slower (1-2 weeks) |
| Discomfort | Minimal | More initially |
| Final results | Same | Same |
| Better for thin corneas | No | Yes |
| Better for active lifestyles | No | Yes |

**PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy)** is the predecessor to LASIK and remains an excellent option for:
- Patients with thin corneas
- Those in contact sports or military
- Patients with certain corneal conditions

### LASIK vs. ICL

| Feature | LASIK | ICL |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Procedure type | Laser reshaping | Implantable lens |
| Reversible | No | Yes |
| Best for high prescriptions | Limited | Excellent |
| Preserves corneal tissue | No | Yes |
| Recovery | 1-2 days | 1-2 days |

**ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens)** is ideal for:
- Very high prescriptions (beyond LASIK range)
- Thin corneas
- Patients who want a reversible procedure
- Those with dry eyes

### LASIK vs. Glasses/Contacts

| Factor | LASIK | Glasses/Contacts |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Upfront cost | Higher | Lower |
| Ongoing costs | Minimal | Continuous |
| Convenience | Maximum | Daily maintenance |
| Sports/activities | Unrestricted | Can be limiting |
| Lifetime value | Often less expensive | Adds up over time |

## The LASIK Procedure

### Before Your Procedure

**Consultation:**
- Comprehensive eye exam
- Corneal mapping and measurements
- Pupil size evaluation
- Tear film assessment
- Discussion of expectations

**Pre-operative instructions:**
- Stop wearing contact lenses (timing varies by lens type)
- Arrange transportation for surgery day
- Avoid eye makeup day of surgery
- Have someone drive you home

### During the Procedure

LASIK is quick—typically 10-15 minutes for both eyes:

1. **Numbing drops** applied to eyes
2. **Eyelid holder** placed to prevent blinking
3. **Corneal flap** created with femtosecond laser
4. **Flap lifted** to expose treatment area
5. **Excimer laser** reshapes cornea (usually 30-60 seconds per eye)
6. **Flap repositioned** (heals naturally, no stitches)

You'll see lights during the procedure but won't feel pain. Many patients describe the experience as strange but not uncomfortable.

### After the Procedure

**Immediately after:**
- Eyes may feel irritated or watery
- Vision may be hazy or blurry
- Rest and keep eyes closed
- Use prescribed drops

**First 24 hours:**
- Sleep with protective shields
- Avoid rubbing eyes
- Use artificial tears frequently
- Most people see significant improvement

**First week:**
- Avoid swimming, hot tubs
- Wear sunglasses outdoors
- Continue eye drops as prescribed
- Avoid eye makeup

**First month:**
- Vision continues to stabilize
- Follow-up appointments
- Report any concerns promptly

## What to Expect: Results and Recovery

### Visual Recovery Timeline

**Day 1**: Most patients can see well enough to function
**Week 1**: Vision significantly improved, may fluctuate slightly
**Month 1**: Vision typically stable, most activities resumed
**Month 3**: Final results usually achieved

### Success Rates

Modern LASIK delivers exceptional results:

- **96%+** of patients achieve 20/20 vision or better
- **99%+** achieve 20/40 or better (legal driving vision)
- High patient satisfaction rates

### Potential Side Effects

**Common (usually temporary):**
- Dry eyes (most common, usually resolves in 3-6 months)
- Glare or halos around lights at night
- Fluctuating vision
- Light sensitivity

**Rare:**
- Under- or over-correction (may need enhancement)
- Infection (very rare with proper care)
- Flap complications
- Vision regression over time

### Enhancements

About 5-10% of LASIK patients may benefit from an enhancement procedure if:
- Initial correction was insufficient
- Vision has changed over time
- Residual astigmatism remains

Enhancements are typically performed after vision has stabilized (usually 3-12 months after initial surgery).

## LASIK Cost in Connecticut

### Price Range

LASIK costs in Connecticut typically range from:
- **$2,000-$3,500 per eye** for standard LASIK
- **$2,500-$4,000 per eye** for advanced/custom LASIK

Factors affecting price:
- Technology used (wavefront, topography-guided)
- Surgeon experience
- Pre/post-operative care included
- Enhancement policies

### What's Included?

Quality LASIK practices typically include:
- Comprehensive pre-operative evaluation
- The surgical procedure
- Post-operative care and follow-up visits
- Enhancement surgery (if needed within specified time)

### Financing Options

Most practices offer:
- Payment plans
- Medical credit (CareCredit, etc.)
- Health Savings Account (HSA) eligible
- Flexible Spending Account (FSA) eligible

### Is LASIK Worth It?

Consider the lifetime cost of glasses and contacts:
- Annual contacts: $300-500
- Glasses (every 2-3 years): $200-500
- Solutions and accessories: $100-200/year

Over 10-20 years, glasses and contacts often cost more than LASIK while providing less convenience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does LASIK hurt?
No. Numbing drops eliminate pain during the procedure. Afterward, eyes may feel scratchy or irritated for a few hours, but significant pain is unusual.

### How long does LASIK last?
LASIK permanently changes the cornea's shape. However, the eye can still change with age. Presbyopia (reading vision loss after 40) and cataracts will still occur, but your distance correction should remain stable.

### Can LASIK be done on both eyes at once?
Yes, treating both eyes in one session is standard practice. It's safe and means one recovery period instead of two.

### When can I return to work?
Most patients return to work within 1-2 days. Computer work is usually fine within a few days, though you may need extra breaks and artificial tears.

### Can I exercise after LASIK?
Light exercise (walking, stationary cycling) can resume in a few days. Avoid swimming, contact sports, and activities with eye injury risk for 2-4 weeks.

### Will I still need reading glasses?
If you're under 40, probably not. After 40, presbyopia (age-related reading difficulty) affects everyone regardless of LASIK. Options exist to address this.

### What if my vision changes later?
Enhancement procedures can often be performed if significant changes occur. Alternatively, glasses or contacts for specific situations are always an option.

### Is LASIK safe?
LASIK is one of the most studied elective procedures ever performed. Serious complications are rare, and patient satisfaction rates are among the highest of any surgical procedure.
