Keratoconus is a progressive eye condition that causes the cornea to thin and bulge into a cone-like shape. This distorts vision and can significantly impact quality of life if left untreated. The good news: modern treatments can slow or halt progression and often restore functional vision.

## What is Keratoconus?

The cornea—the clear, dome-shaped front of the eye—is normally round like a basketball. In keratoconus, the cornea gradually thins and bulges outward, becoming cone-shaped. This irregular shape causes:

- Distorted, blurry vision
- Increased nearsightedness
- Irregular astigmatism
- Light sensitivity
- Difficulty with glasses correction

Keratoconus typically begins in the teenage years or early 20s and may progress for 10-20 years before stabilizing.

## What Causes Keratoconus?

The exact cause isn't fully understood, but factors include:

**Genetic predisposition**: About 10% of keratoconus patients have an affected family member.

**Eye rubbing**: Chronic, vigorous eye rubbing is strongly associated with keratoconus progression. If you have keratoconus or are at risk, stop rubbing your eyes.

**Associated conditions**: Higher rates in people with:
- Allergies (leading to eye rubbing)
- Down syndrome
- Connective tissue disorders
- Some retinal conditions

## Recognizing the Symptoms

Early symptoms often mimic common vision problems:

- Frequent changes in glasses prescription
- Glasses not fully correcting vision
- Blurry or distorted vision
- Increased light sensitivity
- Glare, especially at night
- Headaches from eye strain

As the condition progresses:
- Multiple images or "ghosting"
- Significant astigmatism
- Unable to achieve clear vision with glasses
- Contact lens intolerance

## How Keratoconus is Diagnosed

Diagnosis requires specialized testing:

**Corneal topography**: Maps the corneal surface and can detect early keratoconus before symptoms appear.

**Corneal pachymetry**: Measures corneal thickness—keratoconic corneas are typically thinner.

**Slit-lamp examination**: Allows direct visualization of corneal changes.

Regular screening is important for family members of keratoconus patients and anyone with risk factors.

## Treatment Options

Treatment goals are twofold:
1. **Stop progression** (if still progressing)
2. **Improve vision**

### Corneal Crosslinking (CXL)

For progressive keratoconus, crosslinking is the only treatment proven to halt progression:

- UV light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) strengthen corneal tissue
- Creates new bonds between collagen fibers
- Stops or slows further corneal weakening
- Outpatient procedure with good safety profile

**Crosslinking is most effective when performed early**—before significant corneal damage occurs. If keratoconus is detected and showing progression, timely crosslinking can prevent the need for transplant.

### Vision Correction Options

**Glasses**: Work in early stages but often insufficient as the condition progresses.

**Soft contact lenses**: May help initially but usually insufficient for irregular astigmatism.

**Specialty contact lenses**: The mainstay of keratoconus vision correction:
- Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses
- Hybrid lenses
- Scleral lenses (increasingly popular—larger, more comfortable)
- Custom soft lenses

These lenses create a smooth optical surface over the irregular cornea.

**Intracorneal ring segments**: Plastic segments implanted in the cornea to flatten and regularize its shape.

### Corneal Transplant

For advanced keratoconus when contact lenses no longer work:

**DALK (Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty)**: Replaces most of the cornea but preserves the innermost layer—often preferred for keratoconus.

**PK (Penetrating Keratoplasty)**: Full-thickness transplant, reserved for severe cases.

Modern crosslinking has dramatically reduced the number of keratoconus patients who need transplant.

## Living with Keratoconus

**Stop rubbing your eyes**: This is critical and may slow progression.

**Manage allergies**: Reduces the urge to rub.

**Protect your eyes**: Wear sunglasses and safety glasses when appropriate.

**Regular follow-up**: Monitor for progression and catch changes early.

**Specialty lens care**: If you wear scleral or RGP lenses, proper care prevents complications.

## The Importance of Early Detection

Keratoconus outcomes are best when detected and treated early:

- Crosslinking can halt progression before significant damage
- Less corneal distortion means better vision correction options
- May prevent the need for transplant altogether

If you have a family history of keratoconus, experience unexplained vision changes, or find that your glasses never quite work well, a comprehensive evaluation with corneal topography is worthwhile.
