When considering laser vision correction, you'll likely encounter two main options: LASIK and PRK. Both are safe, effective procedures that can reduce or eliminate your dependence on glasses and contacts. Understanding their differences can help you make an informed decision.

## The Key Difference: The Corneal Flap

The fundamental distinction between LASIK and PRK is how the surgeon accesses the corneal tissue for reshaping.

**LASIK**: Creates a thin hinged flap in the cornea, which is lifted, the laser treatment applied, and the flap replaced.

**PRK**: Removes the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium), applies the laser treatment, and allows the epithelium to regenerate naturally.

## Comparing the Procedures

| Factor | LASIK | PRK |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Corneal flap | Yes | No |
| Recovery time | 1-2 days | 1-2 weeks |
| Initial discomfort | Minimal | Moderate (3-5 days) |
| Final visual outcome | Excellent | Excellent |
| Risk of flap complications | Small risk | None (no flap) |
| Better for thin corneas | No | Yes |
| Better for contact sports | No | Yes |

## When LASIK May Be Better

LASIK might be the right choice if you:
- Have adequate corneal thickness
- Want the fastest possible recovery
- Need to return to work quickly
- Prefer minimal post-operative discomfort

## When PRK May Be Better

PRK might be preferable if you:
- Have thin corneas
- Participate in contact sports or activities with eye injury risk
- Work in professions where flap complications could be problematic (military, certain athletes)
- Have certain corneal surface conditions
- Prefer a procedure without a permanent corneal flap

## The Same Laser, Same Results

Here's the important thing to understand: **both procedures use the same laser to achieve the same reshaping of the cornea**. The difference is only in how the surgeon prepares the eye for treatment.

Studies consistently show that LASIK and PRK achieve equivalent final visual outcomes. The main differences are in the recovery experience, not the long-term results.

## Recovery Comparison

### LASIK Recovery
- Most patients see well the next day
- Minimal discomfort (scratchy feeling for a few hours)
- Eye drops for a few weeks
- Most activities resumed within days

### PRK Recovery
- Vision is blurry for the first 3-5 days
- Moderate discomfort (managed with drops and medication)
- Bandage contact lens worn for about a week
- Eye drops for several weeks
- Best vision achieved over 1-3 months

## The Bottom Line

Neither procedure is "better" than the other—they're different tools for the same goal. The right choice depends on your specific anatomy, lifestyle, and preferences.

During your consultation, we'll evaluate your:
- Corneal thickness and shape
- Prescription and pupil size
- Eye health and tear production
- Lifestyle and visual demands
- Personal preferences

This comprehensive evaluation ensures you receive the procedure best suited to your eyes and goals.
