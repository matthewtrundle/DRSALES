If you've been diagnosed with Fuchs' dystrophy or another condition affecting your corneal endothelium, you may have heard about DMEK surgery. This advanced procedure has revolutionized how we treat corneal endothelial disease, offering faster recovery and better outcomes than ever before.

## Understanding DMEK

**DMEK (Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty)** is a highly specialized corneal transplant technique that replaces only the thin inner layer of the cornea responsible for keeping it clear. Unlike traditional full-thickness corneal transplants, DMEK is a targeted procedure that offers several advantages.

### How DMEK Works

The cornea has five layers. The innermost layer, the endothelium, consists of cells that pump fluid out of the cornea to keep it clear. In conditions like Fuchs' dystrophy, these cells gradually fail, causing the cornea to swell and vision to blur.

DMEK surgery replaces just this thin layer (about 10-15 microns thick—thinner than a human hair) with healthy donor tissue. The procedure:

1. Removes the patient's damaged endothelial layer
2. Inserts a thin layer of donor tissue through a small incision
3. Positions the new tissue using an air bubble
4. Allows natural healing without sutures

## Why DMEK is Considered the Gold Standard

### Faster Visual Recovery

Most DMEK patients notice significant vision improvement within weeks, not months. Many achieve their best vision within 1-3 months—much faster than older transplant techniques.

### Better Final Vision

Studies consistently show that DMEK patients achieve better final visual acuity:
- 80-90% achieve 20/25 vision or better
- This is superior to other transplant methods

### Lower Rejection Risk

Because DMEK transplants less tissue, the body is less likely to reject it:
- Rejection rate less than 1% per year
- Most rejection episodes are treatable if caught early

### No Sutures

DMEK grafts heal naturally without stitches, eliminating:
- Suture-related complications
- The need for suture removal
- Astigmatism from sutures

## Who Benefits from DMEK?

DMEK is primarily for conditions affecting the corneal endothelium:

- **Fuchs' dystrophy** (most common indication)
- **Bullous keratopathy** (post-surgical corneal swelling)
- **Failed previous corneal transplants**
- **Other endothelial dystrophies**

## What to Expect

The procedure is performed as outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. Most patients go home within a few hours of surgery.

**Recovery involves:**
- Lying face-up for the first several hours
- Using multiple eye drops
- Several follow-up visits in the first few weeks
- Gradual return to normal activities

## Is DMEK Right for You?

If you're experiencing symptoms of corneal endothelial disease—particularly morning blur that improves during the day—a consultation can determine if DMEK is appropriate for your situation.

Dr. Sales is internationally recognized for his expertise in DMEK surgery, having performed thousands of procedures and trained surgeons worldwide in this advanced technique.
