Fuchs' dystrophy is a progressive corneal condition that affects approximately 4% of adults over 40. Understanding its symptoms can help you seek appropriate treatment before the condition significantly impacts your quality of life.

## The Classic Symptom: Morning Blur

The hallmark symptom of Fuchs' dystrophy is **vision that's worse upon waking and improves as the day goes on**. This happens because:

1. During sleep, your closed eyes prevent tear evaporation
2. Fluid accumulates in the already compromised cornea overnight
3. You wake up with your cornea at its most swollen
4. As you blink and air evaporates surface fluid, vision clears

If you find yourself unable to read or see clearly in the morning, only to have your vision sharpen within an hour or two, Fuchs' dystrophy could be the cause.

## Progressive Symptoms by Stage

### Early Stage
- Occasional morning haziness
- Slight difficulty in low-light conditions
- Often no symptoms at all (discovered during routine eye exams)

### Moderate Stage
- Morning blur lasting longer into the day
- Noticeable difficulty reading in dim light
- Glare and halos around lights, especially at night
- Colors may appear less vibrant
- Increasing light sensitivity

### Advanced Stage
- Constant blurred vision throughout the day
- Eye pain or discomfort (from bullae—small blisters on the cornea)
- Foreign body sensation
- Severe light sensitivity
- Significant impact on daily activities

## When to See a Specialist

Seek evaluation if you experience:
- Morning blur that takes longer to clear
- Increasing difficulty with night driving
- Persistent light sensitivity
- Any eye pain or discomfort
- Vision changes that don't improve with new glasses

Early diagnosis allows for better management and helps determine the optimal timing for treatment if surgery becomes necessary.

## Getting a Proper Diagnosis

A cornea specialist can diagnose Fuchs' dystrophy through:

- **Slit-lamp examination**: Viewing the cornea under magnification
- **Corneal pachymetry**: Measuring corneal thickness
- **Specular microscopy**: Counting and evaluating endothelial cells
- **Corneal topography**: Mapping the corneal surface

If you're experiencing symptoms or have a family history of Fuchs' dystrophy (it's hereditary), consider scheduling an evaluation. Learn more in our [complete guide to Fuchs' dystrophy](/guides/fuchs-dystrophy).
